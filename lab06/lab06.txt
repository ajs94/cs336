6.1
a.	There aren't any http methods that curl can't used.
b.	404 would be a good 'catch all' for undefined paths. Maybe if there was a specific
		reason, you could use others like 400 Bad Request or 404 Forbidden
6.2
a.	Curl can only use get and post methods.
b.	The server accesses the three peices of data like three items with their json name.
