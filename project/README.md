The People’s Piano
	
	The People’s Piano will be an SPA with an interface that will provide users a way to play and listen to one another on the piano. 
	The site will use the Web MIDI API to allow users to use their keyboards to perform music for an audience. 
	Listening to another player's piano will be integrating using WebSockets so that the music can be heard  in real time.
	
	We’ll have a lobby that people queue to be in. 
	The people in the lobby take turns performing on the piano while the other viewers in or outside the lobby watch and listen to them play in real time. 
	There will be a global chat for game; we’re planning on integrating chat from the streaming service Twitch.tv.
