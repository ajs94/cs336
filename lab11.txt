11.1

	A. Compare and contrast your development and production deployments and explain how each is designed.
	
		Production environments is meant to similar to a final product. It's not meant to be updated
			in real time like how a development environment is.

	B. List the optimizations youâ€™ve configured for this production version and, if possible, find evidence of then in the deployed application files.

		OccurenceOrderPlugin - Webpack gives IDs to identify your modules. With this plugin, Webpack will analyze and prioritize often used 
			modules assigning them the smallest ids.
		ExtractTextPlugin - It moves every css requires/imports into a separate css output file (So your styles are no longer inlined into the JavaScript).
		UglifyJsPlugin - UglifyJS is a JavaScript compressor/minifier.

		All are within the webpack.production.config.js file.

11.2

	A. What advantage is there is deploying an application to a PaaS tool like Heroku?
	
		It simplifies creating a web application by removing or lessening consideration on managment and maintaining of the service as well as increasing the
			long term scalability of a project.

	B. How does Heroku know how to install and run your application (after pulling it from the specified branch on GitHub)?

		We set the code for this project to Node.js so it knows how to interpret it. 
		It npm installs and builds using the 'scripts' in the package.json and webpack.production.config.js files.
